# CP341 - Parallel Programming
Course repository of Mishig Davaadorj

## Getting Started

#### From Wikipedia:
Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time.
#### Textbook:
* [Structured Parallel Programming: Patterns for Efficient Computation](http://parallelbook.com/)

#### Frameworks used:

* [OpenMP](http://www.openmp.org/) -  application programming interface that supports multi-platform shared memory multiprocessing programming in C, C++
* [CilkPlus](https://www.cilkplus.org/) - extension to the C and C++ languages to support data and task parallelism
