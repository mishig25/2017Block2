1. What is Moore's Law and why is it relevant to computing?
Moore's Law is an observation that states number of silicon chips in a computer doubles every 2 years.
It is relevant to computing since more transistors can do more computations; therefore, according to Moore's law, we should be getting a double increase in our computational power every two years.

2. What is the significance of processor clock speed? If we measure processor computational power as FLOPS, how could a 500 Mhz processor out perform a 1 Ghz processor?
Clock speed measures rate at which circuits could be clocked. Higher clock speed means higher performance.
500 Mhz processor can perform a 1 Ghz processor by running a parallel version of executions the 1 Ghz processor running serially.

3. What are some ways we might measure and compare computer capability? List FLOPS and two options, discuss strengths/weaknesses of each.
We can measure and compare computer capability using a variety of different measures.
I. FLOPS
  strengths: commonly used
  weaknesses: can be tricked by using smart hacks, depends on the architecture
II. Power Consumption
  strengths: good theoretical overview from Physics side
  weaknesses: hard to translate to other computational measures
III. Number of Transistors
  strengths: basis of Moore's law
  weaknesses: gives different results for serial VS parallel programs
